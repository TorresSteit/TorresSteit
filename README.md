### 🧩 Code Quality & Best Practices

- Apply Clean Code principles in real projects
- Use meaningful and descriptive naming for variables, methods, and classes
- Write readable, maintainable, and structured code
- Follow layered architecture and proper separation of concerns
- Use DTO pattern for clean data transfer
- Apply SOLID principles in backend design
- Maintain consistent code style and project structure
- Focus on scalability and maintainability of backend systems
- Apply best practices learned from "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin

SOLID principles applied in practice:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) — each class has a single responsibility (Controller, Service, Repository separation)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP) — design services to be extendable without modifying core logic
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) — use dependency injection in Spring Boot
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) — use focused interfaces for clear responsibilities

- Spring Boot backend
- React frontend
- Authentication systems (JWT, sessions)
- REST API architecture
- Secure web applications
